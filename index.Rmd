## An Customizable Textbook

This book is meant to be a starting point for you to learn design and analysis of experiments. You should feel free to edit the Rmarkdown files so that the book becomes your own.

### How to Use This Book

Under Principles of Experiments the most foundational issues and decisions facing each experimenter must be aware of and think about.

The Specific Designs section addresses specific designs we will learn about in this course. Each design will have an image next to it representing the diagram of the structural factors. 

This list is by no means exhaustive. The taxonomy used for the drop-down works well when we want to cover just these basic few designs but a new taxonomy may work better if more complex designs are considered. Within each of these designs there are subsections: 

* Overview
* Design/Randomization
* Model Structure and Decomposition
* Analysis Using R
    *   Numerical and graphical summaries
    *   Hypothesis Testing
    *   Assumption Checking
    
The section labeled Broad Topics seeks to address topics that are relevant to many experiment designs.

You are welcome to add additional specific designs or add to the list of broad topics.
